- bug: autosave doesn’t trigger if no keyboard activity – noticed during usability test w/ Lauren
- "I clicked publish, nothing happened. Waited 10s" — user in trial account (limited tier?)
- Need: autosave every X seconds? (configurable?) → story?
- File structure gets messy when >10 drafts. Should auto-collapse?

- 👇 Whiteboard sketch captured:
  Feature gating matrix:

- Need to refactor permission service → too many conditionals (line 123+, `accessControl.js`)
- Spike: evaluate new feature flag tools → LaunchDarkly vs Statsig? Performance, ease of use.

- "Users don't understand what 'Sync Source' means" → rename? Add tooltip?

- 🧠 New user journey feedback (from Grace):
    - "Too many steps before I can actually try anything."
    - Possible fix: pre-fill sandbox environment with sample data
    - 🟢 Could be fast win → maybe a story?

- Cmd+K palette: confirmed we want this. Add shortcuts for:
    - Go to Project
    - Toggle Dark Mode
    - Open Last File
  ✅ All supported in frontend router

- ✅ Clear ask from CS team:
    > “Need ability to bulk reassign tasks to another user — huge pain right now”
    - Currently one at a time via modal
    - Add checkbox + bulk action menu
    - Should appear in `TaskList.vue`

- ✍️ “Revisions view” draft idea — something like Google Docs version history?
    - What’s stored per version? Full snapshot or diff?
    - Need research (Spike)

- Someone asked “what happens if a user deletes a project while another team member is editing?” — sounds like a race condition

- bug? Safari 14 - file uploads just hang (no error shown) → backend or client?

- Confusion around login state — SSO token expiry causes “random” logout
    - Sentry issue `#401-expired-refresh`
    - Maybe just needs better UX fallback?

- Idea: highlight stale branches in Git integration tab (gray out after 30d no commits?) → low-hanging fruit?

- TODO: Check if we're duplicating telemetry pings on Settings save
- “Document upload” should support drag & drop → seems like it's only via button now
