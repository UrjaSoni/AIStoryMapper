Please extract well-structured user stories and spikes from the currently open transcript file.

At the very top of your output, add this metadata block:

# User Stories and Spikes - Contoso Integration Review  
**Generated from:** [transcript or note file name] 
**Date:** [date the document is generated]  
**Total Items:** [count of all user stories + spikes]  

For each story or spike, include:  
- Title  
- User persona  
- Goal (I want to...)  
- Description  
- Acceptance criteria  
- Tags  
- Clarifying questions/gaps  
- Status (Ready or Refinement)

Format the output as a numbered markdown list.

Create all relevant items needed to fully cover the content of the transcript.

Provide the output as if you are creating a new standalone markdown document that can be saved uniquely each time (e.g., user-stories-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md).

Do not add anything outside this format.
